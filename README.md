# PyHisstorian
The only thing worse than the pun is the database!

# Mission Statement
The purpose of this project is simply to learn as much as possible about Git, GitHub, Python, databases and programming in general.  To that end, the project will center around creating a database for time series data and peripheral applications to populate and view data in the database.  This will provide a good excuse to play around with many aspects of programming.
